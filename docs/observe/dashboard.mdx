The Acontext dashboard provides a unified interface for monitoring and analyzing your AI agent's behavior. Access real-time insights into tasks, messages, sessions, and skills to understand how your agent processes information and executes operations.

## Overview

The dashboard gives you complete visibility into your agent's operations through five specialized views. Each view is designed to help you monitor different aspects of your agent's performance and debug issues quickly.

<Tip>
Use the dashboard filters to narrow down specific time ranges or search for particular operations when troubleshooting issues.
</Tip>

## Metrics

Gain high-level insights into your agent's overall performance through aggregated metrics and visualizations. The BI dashboard helps you identify trends, measure success, and make data-driven decisions about your agent's configuration.

The BI dashboard includes:
- **Performance trends**: Visualize task completion rates and execution times over time
- **Success metrics**: Track overall agent success rates and error patterns
- **Resource utilization**: Monitor system resource consumption
- **Custom analytics**: Create and save custom views for specific metrics

<Tip>
Export BI dashboard data to integrate with your existing analytics tools or create custom reports for stakeholders.
